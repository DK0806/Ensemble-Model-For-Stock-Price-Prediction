# Ensemble Models Implementation

## Overview
This repository contains the implementation of eight ensemble models to enhance predictive accuracy and robustness.

## Models Included
- LSTM , GRU  , LIGHTGBM , Linear Regression , Ridge Regression
- we have used various loss functions for optimization like correlation loss , MAE , MSE in different combinations .
found out lstm with correlation and GRU with mse works best

## File
- **`Ensemble_Model.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook with all implementations.

## Requirements
just run in colab 

## DATA source 
yfinance api
